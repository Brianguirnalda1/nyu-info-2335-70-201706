## Description

> This course represents an opportunity for students to learn how to code, regardless of whether or not they possess prior programming experience. The Python programming language will be introduced with a progression of concepts from basic to intermediate. Students will then design and implement practical applications of the Python programming language ranging from basic scripts to intermediate programs. Throughout the semester, students will be immersed in contemporary software development practices and should emerge with marketable technology-related knowledge and skills.

### Prerequisites

This course has no prerequisites.

## Scope

TBA

## Objectives

TBA

## Materials

As a matter of principle, all course materials are free and open.

### Textbooks

This course does not require or follow any textbook,
 however students will be expected to read significant quantities of online documentation
 and resources from a variety of sources.

### Computers

Each student should possess a personal computer or have access to one during class.
The computer must allow installation of Python, third-party packages, and other software such as a text editor.
The computer should have enough processing power to run several programs at once, thus some netbooks may prove problematic.
In theory, both Mac and Windows operating systems should provide a proper development environment,
 however students with Windows computers may expect to face additional and/or alternate instructions.
Students may [loan laptops from the library](https://library.nyu.edu/services/computing/on-campus/laptop-loans/) for use during class.

### Software

#### Chat

TBA - All course communications will take place in [Slack](#). The professor will invite all students to the Slack organization at the beginning of the semester. Any student who registers late must request a Slack invitation from the professor on their first official day of class.

#### Calendar

Students are encouraged to subscribe to or otherwise observe the course's official [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=prof.mj.rossetti%40gmail.com&ctz=America/New_York).

#### Text Editor

Each student is expected to achieve proficiency using a text editor of choice.
Ideally, the text editor should include syntax auto-completion functionality for the Python language.
The official text editor for this course is [Atom](https://atom.io/),
 however [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
 and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) are potential alternatives.

#### Command-line Utilities

TBA - The following command-line utilities will be covered throughout the course of the semester:

  + Git
  + Python
  + Heroku Toolbelt

## Learning Community

The maximum enrollment for this section is 50 students.

Michael Rossetti ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikerossetti), [GitHub](https://github.com/s2t2))
 will be administering the course and teaching all course material.
 If you have a question about assignments, projects, or anything covered in class,
 DM Professor Rossetti on Slack,
 or email him at [mrossett@stern.nyu.edu](mailto:mrossett@stern.nyu.edu).
 The professor aims to provide an average response time of 2-3 business days.
 If emailing the professor, please use your university-issued email address.
