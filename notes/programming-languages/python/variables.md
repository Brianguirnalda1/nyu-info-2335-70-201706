# Python Language Overview

## Variables

Use a variable to store some value in the program's temporary memory. Declare a variable using a name and assign its value by using a single equal sign (`=`) followed by the value. Any object can be stored in a variable.

```python
my_bool = True
my_int = 10
my_float = 0.45
my_str = "My Message"
my_list = [1,2,3,4]
my_dict = {"a":1, "b":2, "c":3}
```

If you try to reference a variable that has not yet been defined, you will see an error like `NameError: name 'my_var' is not defined`.
