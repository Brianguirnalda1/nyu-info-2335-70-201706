Python can be run on the "server-side" (i.e. on your computer or some other server). Get started with Python by [installing](installation.md) it onto your computer. Then you should be able to run `python` from the command-line to access the interactive interpreter. When you are done using the interpreter, shut it down with `exit()`. You can alternatively write scripts and execute them from the command-line. For example, `python hello.py`. Using either of these methods, you should be able to follow-along with each of the sections below.
