# JavaScript Language Overview

## Syntax and Style

You may see JavaScript statements ended with a trailing semi-colon. In some cases it is necessary to use these trailing semi-colons, but you are generally free to omit them.

Always observe lower-case variable and function names. If your variable or function name is comprised of two words, use camel-case, not snake case or title-case.

```` js

name
firstName

// DON'T:
