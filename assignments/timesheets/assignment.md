# Student Timesheets

## Instructions

Each week before Sunday at 11:59pm, please take a few moments to fill-out a [student timesheet](https://goo.gl/forms/xIU4RXLnFpl7gRq02). Your responses help instructors monitor your individual progress and identify intervention opportunities to prevent you from falling behind. They also help instructors evaluate their own instructional methods.

## Evaluation

Six weekly timesheets are collectively worth 12% towards your final grade.

Each on-time submission counts as 2%.
